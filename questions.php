        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
				<h4>I am an immediate relative of ... Can you use this picture instead?</h4>
				<p>Sure! If you have a picture of a victim that you would prefer for me to use, please email me <a href="contact.php">here</a>. I would prefer to use pictures from victims' families rather than from the general media. I will also give you credit so that you hold copyright of the image.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4>This information about ... is incorrect. Can you change it?</strong></h4>
				<p>Yes. If you see anything on here that you think is incorrect, please don't hesitate to let me know by <a href="contact.php">sending an email</a>! This resource is intended to be as accurate as possible.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4>How can I help contribute?</h4>
				<p>There are currently plans to expand the website so that anyone can add to it. However, those features won't be created for quite some time. If you have information that you would like to be seen on the website (for example: biographical information about a victim), please send me an email and I will add it to the website as soon as I get a chance.</p>
				<p>You can also help contribute by donating <a href="#"><strong>here</strong></a>. I am currently running this website during my spare time and donations would allow me to spend more time updating the website with more incidents, victims, and content.</p>
