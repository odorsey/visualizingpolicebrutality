This is a repo that holds the initial files for the current [visualizingpolicebrutality.org](http://visualizingpolicebrutality.org/) website. Please view for insight into how I created certain features on the current site.

*Feel free to play with as you like; I have the files backed up and can download the files again from the server at any time.*
